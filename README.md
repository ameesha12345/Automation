I built an AI-powered Resume Shortlisting System using n8n + Google Drive + Google Sheets + Gemini API.
Hereâ€™s how it works:
âœ… Candidate submits application â†’ data stored in Sheets & resume uploaded to Drive
âœ… Resume automatically downloaded and evaluated via Gemini API
âœ… If score â‰¥ 7 â†’ sends a Shortlisted email
âœ… Otherwise â†’ sends a Rejected email

This automation saves time, reduces manual effort, and makes the process more efficient.
Super thrilled to explore more possibilities with n8n and workflow automation! ðŸ’¡
